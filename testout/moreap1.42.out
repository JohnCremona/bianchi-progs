Program moreap1: for given field and level, assumes that the newforms file exists, and computes more individual Hecke eigenvalues.
---------------

>>>> Level 14.1 = (a,-14), norm = 14 <<<<

1 newform(s) at level 14.1 = (a,-14) (up to twist by unramified character):
1:	basis = [];	aqlist = [ 1 1 ];	aplist = [ -1 2 -1 4 4 -6 -6 0 0 -10 -6 ]
Sign of F.E. = -1
Making homspace and bases...done.
