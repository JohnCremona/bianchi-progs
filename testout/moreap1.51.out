Program moreap1: for given field and level, assumes that the newforms file exists, and computes more individual Hecke eigenvalues.
---------------

>>>> Level 17.1 = (-1+2a,-9+a), norm = 17 <<<<

1 newform(s) at level 17.1 = (-1+2a,-9+a) (up to twist by unramified character):
1:	basis = [];	aqlist = [ 1 ];	aplist = [ 0 -3 2 2 0 0 -2 -2 -1 -4 -4 -4 -4 -6 -6 6 6 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 8 8 -8 -8 14 14 ]
Sign of F.E. = -1
Twisting prime lambda = 1, factor = 8
L/P ratio    = 1/2, cuspidal factor = 4
Integration matrix = [-6-4a,-a;9-a,2], factor   = 8
Making homspace and bases...done.
