Program moreap1: for given field and level, assumes that the newforms file exists, and computes more individual Hecke eigenvalues.

>>>> Level 9.2 = (3), norm = 9 <<<<

1 newform(s) at level 9.2 = (3) (up to twist by unramified character):

Sign of F.E. = 1
Twisting prime lambda = 1, factor = 120
L/P ratio    = 3, cuspidal factor = 5
Integration matrix = [-22,-1-a;3-3a,2], factor   = 10
Making homspace and bases...done.
