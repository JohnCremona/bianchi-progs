Program moreap1: for given field and level, assumes that the newforms file exists, and computes more individual Hecke eigenvalues.

>>>> Level 9.1 = (a), norm = 9 <<<<

1 newform(s) at level 9.1 = (a) (up to twist by unramified character):
1:	basis = [];	aqlist = [ -1 ];	aplist = [ 0 0 3 0 0 -4 4 0 0 0 0 2 -2 0 0 -16 16 0 0 -8 -8 0 0 0 0 0 0 18 18 22 ]
Sign of F.E. = 1
Unramified self-twist by discriminant -7
Making homspace and bases...done.
