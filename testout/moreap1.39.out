Program moreap1: for given field and level, assumes that the newforms file exists, and computes more individual Hecke eigenvalues.

>>>> Level 4.2 = (2), norm = 4 <<<<

1 newform(s) at level 4.2 = (2) (up to twist by unramified character):
1:	basis = [];	aqlist = [ -1 1 ];	aplist = [ 1 -1 1 3 -3 0 0 -4 0 0 -1 -1 3 -3 5 6 -6 8 8 15 -15 -10 -10 -6 6 -6 6 14 14 2 ]
Sign of F.E. = 1
Twisting prime lambda = 1, factor = 360
L/P ratio    = 4, cuspidal factor = 15
Integration matrix = [7,a;2-2a,3], factor   = 15
Making homspace and bases...done.
