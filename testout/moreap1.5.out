Program moreap1: for given field and level, assumes that the newforms file exists, and computes more individual Hecke eigenvalues.
---------------

>>>> Level 16.1 = (4), norm = 16 <<<<

1 newform(s) at level 16.1 = (4) (up to twist by unramified character):
1:	basis = [];	aqlist = [ -1 ];	aplist = [ 0 2 -2 2 2 -2 2 -2 -2 -2 -2 -2 -6 6 6 -6 10 10 14 -14 -2 2 -6 -6 6 6 14 -14 -10 10 ]
Sign of F.E. = 1
Twisting prime lambda = 1, factor = 8
L/P ratio    = 1, cuspidal factor = 4
Integration matrix = [3a,2;-8,a], factor   = 4
Making homspace and bases...done.
