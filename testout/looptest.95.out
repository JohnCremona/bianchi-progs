Quads in order of norm:
Quad = 1	with norm 1
Quad = 2	with norm 4
Quad = 3	with norm 9
Quad = 4	with norm 16
Quad = a	with norm 24
Quad = 5	with norm 25
Quad = 1+a	with norm 26
Quad = 2+a	with norm 30
Quad = 6	with norm 36
Quad = 3+a	with norm 36
Quad = 4+a	with norm 44
Quad = 7	with norm 49
-------------------------------------------

Quads with each possible norm from 1 to 50:
Norm 1:	[ 1 ]
Norm 4:	[ 2 ]
Norm 9:	[ 3 ]
Norm 16:	[ 4 ]
Norm 24:	[ a ]
Norm 25:	[ 5 ]
Norm 26:	[ 1+a ]
Norm 30:	[ 2+a ]
Norm 36:	[ 6 3+a ]
Norm 44:	[ 4+a ]
Norm 49:	[ 7 ]
