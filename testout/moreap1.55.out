Program moreap1: for given field and level, assumes that the newforms file exists, and computes more individual Hecke eigenvalues.
---------------

>>>> Level 11.1 = (5+a,-6+a), norm = 11 <<<<

1 newform(s) at level 11.1 = (5+a,-6+a) (up to twist by unramified character):
1:	basis = [];	aqlist = [ -1 ];	aplist = [ 2 2 1 2 2 -5 1 -4 -4 2 2 7 7 6 6 ]
Sign of F.E. = 1
Making homspace and bases...done.
