Program moreap1: for given field and level, assumes that the newforms file exists, and computes more individual Hecke eigenvalues.

>>>> Level 24.1 = (-6+2a,-6-2a), norm = 24 <<<<

1 newform(s) at level 24.1 = (-6+2a,-6-2a) (up to twist by unramified character):
1:	basis = [];	aqlist = [ 1 -1 ];	aplist = [ 0 1 2 2 0 4 4 -2 -2 4 4 -8 -8 -8 -8 6 6 6 6 8 8 6 6 18 18 ]
Sign of F.E. = 1
Twisting prime lambda = 1, factor = 96
L/P ratio    = 3/2, cuspidal factor = 2
Integration matrix = [-10+a,3;4a,2-a], factor   = 2
Making homspace and bases...done.
