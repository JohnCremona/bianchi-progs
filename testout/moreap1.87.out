Program moreap1: for given field and level, assumes that the newforms file exists, and computes more individual Hecke eigenvalues.
---------------

>>>> Level 9.1 = (3), norm = 9 <<<<

1 newform(s) at level 9.1 = (3) (up to twist by unramified character):
1:	basis = [];	aqlist = [ -1 ];	aplist = [ 1 -1 0 2 2 3 -3 3 3 -6 6 1 0 -2 2 ]
Sign of F.E. = 1
Twisting prime lambda = 1, factor = 50
L/P ratio    = 1, cuspidal factor = 1
Integration matrix = [-65,1-2a;3-6a,4], factor   = 6
Making homspace and bases...done.
