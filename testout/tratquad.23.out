Enter field: Enter max. norm for primes: The field is Q(sqrt(-23))	discriminant = 23	min poly(a) = a^2-a+6.
Class number 3
Ideal class group representatives: [ [1,a] [2,a] [2,1+a] ]

Enter Quads, a and b: a = 12+34a
b = 56+78a
q = a/b = (6+17a)/(28+39a)
b*q==a? 1
round(q) = 0
translation_reduce(q) = (6+17a)/(28+39a)
q==round(q)+translation_reduce(q)? 1
recip(q) = (28+39a)/(6+17a)
ideal(q) = [2,a] = P2a
q = (6+17a)/(28+39a) is not principal
denominator_ideal(q) = [5501,3527+a] = P5501b
representation of q with ideal coprime to 2*3*5: (66+31a)/(187+64a), which has ideal [13,8+a] = P13b (and the same denominator ideal)
