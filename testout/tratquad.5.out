Enter field: Enter max. norm for primes: The field is Q(sqrt(-5))	discriminant = -20	min poly(a) = a^2+5.
Class number 2
Ideal class group representatives: [ [1,a] [2,1+a] ]

Enter Quads, a and b: a = 12+3a
b = 45+6a
q = a/b = (1+a)/(5+3a)
b*q==a? 1
round(q) = 0
translation_reduce(q) = (1+a)/(5+3a)
q==round(q)+translation_reduce(q)? 1
recip(q) = (5+3a)/(1+a)
ideal(q) = [2,1+a] = P2
q = (1+a)/(5+3a) is not principal
denominator_ideal(q) = [35,25+a] = P5*P7b
representation of q with ideal coprime to 2*3*5: (-1+2a)/(7a), which has ideal [7,3+a] = P7a (and the same denominator ideal)
