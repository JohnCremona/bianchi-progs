Quad = a	with norm 10
Quad = 1+a	with norm 11
Quad = 2+a	with norm 14
Quad = 4	with norm 16
Quad = 3+a	with norm 19
Quad = 5	with norm 25
Quad = 4+a	with norm 26
Quad = 5+a	with norm 35
Quad = 6	with norm 36
Quad = 2a	with norm 40
Quad = 1+2a	with norm 41
Quad = 2+2a	with norm 44
Quad = 6+a	with norm 46
Quad = 7	with norm 49
Quad = 3+2a	with norm 49
