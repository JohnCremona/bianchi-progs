Quads in order of norm:
Quad = 1	with norm 1
Quad = 2	with norm 4
Quad = 3	with norm 9
Quad = a	with norm 13
Quad = 1+a	with norm 15
Quad = 4	with norm 16
Quad = 2+a	with norm 19
Quad = 5	with norm 25
Quad = 3+a	with norm 25
Quad = 4+a	with norm 33
Quad = 6	with norm 36
Quad = 5+a	with norm 43
Quad = 7	with norm 49

Quads with each possible norm from 1 to 50:
Norm 1:	[ 1 ]
Norm 4:	[ 2 ]
Norm 9:	[ 3 ]
Norm 13:	[ a ]
Norm 15:	[ 1+a ]
Norm 16:	[ 4 ]
Norm 19:	[ 2+a ]
Norm 25:	[ 5 3+a ]
Norm 33:	[ 4+a ]
Norm 36:	[ 6 ]
Norm 43:	[ 5+a ]
