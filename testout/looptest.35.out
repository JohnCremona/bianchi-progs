Quad = 1	with norm 1
Quad = 2	with norm 4
Quad = 3	with norm 9
Quad = a	with norm 9
Quad = 1+a	with norm 11
Quad = 2+a	with norm 15
Quad = 4	with norm 16
Quad = 3+a	with norm 21
Quad = 5	with norm 25
Quad = 4+a	with norm 29
Quad = -1+2a	with norm 35
Quad = 6	with norm 36
Quad = 2a	with norm 36
Quad = 5+a	with norm 39
Quad = 1+2a	with norm 39
Quad = 2+2a	with norm 44
Quad = 7	with norm 49
