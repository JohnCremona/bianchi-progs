Quads in order of norm:
Quad = 1	with norm 1
Quad = 2	with norm 4
Quad = 3	with norm 9
Quad = a	with norm 11
Quad = 1+a	with norm 13
Quad = 4	with norm 16
Quad = 2+a	with norm 17
Quad = 3+a	with norm 23
Quad = 5	with norm 25
Quad = 4+a	with norm 31
Quad = 6	with norm 36
Quad = 5+a	with norm 41
Quad = -1+2a	with norm 43
Quad = 2a	with norm 44
Quad = 1+2a	with norm 47
Quad = 7	with norm 49

Quads with each possible norm from 1 to 50:
Norm 1:	[ 1 ]
Norm 4:	[ 2 ]
Norm 9:	[ 3 ]
Norm 11:	[ a ]
Norm 13:	[ 1+a ]
Norm 16:	[ 4 ]
Norm 17:	[ 2+a ]
Norm 23:	[ 3+a ]
Norm 25:	[ 5 ]
Norm 31:	[ 4+a ]
Norm 36:	[ 6 ]
Norm 41:	[ 5+a ]
Norm 43:	[ -1+2a ]
Norm 44:	[ 2a ]
Norm 47:	[ 1+2a ]
Norm 49:	[ 7 ]
-------------------------------------------

Quads with norms up to 25 in one list: 
[ 1 2 3 a 1+a 4 2+a 3+a 5 ]
Quads with norms from 26 to 50 in separate lists: 
Norm 31:	[ 4+a ]
Norm 36:	[ 6 ]
Norm 41:	[ 5+a ]
Norm 43:	[ -1+2a ]
Norm 44:	[ 2a ]
Norm 47:	[ 1+2a ]
Norm 49:	[ 7 ]
Norm 52:	[ 2+2a ]
