Quads in order of norm:
Quad = 1	with norm 1
Quad = 2	with norm 4
Quad = 3	with norm 9
Quad = 4	with norm 16
Quad = a	with norm 20
Quad = 1+a	with norm 22
Quad = 5	with norm 25
Quad = 2+a	with norm 26
Quad = 3+a	with norm 32
Quad = 6	with norm 36
Quad = 4+a	with norm 40
Quad = 7	with norm 49
Quad = 5+a	with norm 50
