Program moreap1: for given field and level, assumes that the newforms file exists, and computes more individual Hecke eigenvalues.
---------------

>>>> Level 16.1 = (4), norm = 16 <<<<

1 newform(s) at level 16.1 = (4) (up to twist by unramified character):
1:	basis = [];	aqlist = [ 1 ];	aplist = [ 0 3 -3 -5 0 0 -4 -3 -3 -6 6 1 0 0 0 0 3 -3 -6 -6 6 -6 -8 -8 12 -12 15 -15 6 -6 ]
Sign of F.E. = -1
Twisting prime lambda = 0, factor = 0
L/P ratio    = 0, cuspidal factor = 5
Integration matrix = [3a,2;-20,a], factor   = 5
Making homspace and bases...done.
