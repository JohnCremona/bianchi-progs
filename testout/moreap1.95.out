Program moreap1: for given field and level, assumes that the newforms file exists, and computes more individual Hecke eigenvalues.
---------------

>>>> Level 16.1 = (-8+a,-8-a), norm = 16 <<<<

1 newform(s) at level 16.1 = (-8+a,-8-a) (up to twist by unramified character):
1:	basis = [];	aqlist = [ -1 ];	aplist = [ 0 0 0 0 1 -5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 15 15 ]
Sign of F.E. = 1
Twisting prime lambda = 1, factor = 90
L/P ratio    = 1, cuspidal factor = 2
Integration matrix = [3+3a,-2+a;8-a,3], factor   = 3
Unramified self-twist by discriminant -19
Making homspace and bases...done.
