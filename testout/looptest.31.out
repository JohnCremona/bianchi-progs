Quad = 1	with norm 1
Quad = 2	with norm 4
Quad = a	with norm 8
Quad = 3	with norm 9
Quad = 1+a	with norm 10
Quad = 2+a	with norm 14
Quad = 4	with norm 16
Quad = 3+a	with norm 20
Quad = 5	with norm 25
Quad = 4+a	with norm 28
Quad = -1+2a	with norm 31
Quad = 2a	with norm 32
Quad = 1+2a	with norm 35
Quad = 6	with norm 36
Quad = 5+a	with norm 38
Quad = 2+2a	with norm 40
Quad = 3+2a	with norm 47
Quad = 7	with norm 49
Quad = 6+a	with norm 50
