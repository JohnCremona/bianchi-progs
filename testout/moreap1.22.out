Program moreap1: for given field and level, assumes that the newforms file exists, and computes more individual Hecke eigenvalues.
---------------

>>>> Level 11.1 = (a,-11), norm = 11 <<<<

1 newform(s) at level 11.1 = (a,-11) (up to twist by unramified character):
1:	basis = [];	aqlist = [ 1 ];	aplist = [ 2 -5 -1 -4 -4 0 0 -1 -1 -9 0 0 7 7 6 6 8 8 -10 -12 -12 -3 -3 6 6 15 15 -7 -7 -2 ]
Sign of F.E. = -1
Twisting prime lambda = 1, factor = 120
L/P ratio    = 4, cuspidal factor = 5
Integration matrix = [-5,-1;11,2], factor   = 20
Making homspace and bases...done.
