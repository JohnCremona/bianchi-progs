Program moreap1: for given field and level, assumes that the newforms file exists, and computes more individual Hecke eigenvalues.
---------------

>>>> Level 28.1 = (6+2a,-8+2a), norm = 28 <<<<

1 newform(s) at level 28.1 = (6+2a,-8+2a) (up to twist by unramified character):
1:	basis = [];	aqlist = [ -1 1 ];	aplist = [ 1 0 0 -1 -2 4 -2 -2 0 0 -6 -6 4 4 -6 ]
Sign of F.E. = 1
